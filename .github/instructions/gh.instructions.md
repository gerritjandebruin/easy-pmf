1. Use `gh` command to manage GitHub operations:
   - `gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Description"` to create issues
   - `gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"` to create pull requests
   - `gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch` to merge and clean up
   - `gh pr view <number>` to view pull request details
   - `gh issue list` and `gh pr list` to view issues and pull requests

3. You will work through the GitHub workflow using the command line, including creating branches, making changes, and submitting pull requests.
