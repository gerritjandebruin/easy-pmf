1. You are working in a PowerShell environment on Windows.

2. Use PowerShell-compatible commands and syntax:
   - Use `Remove-Item` instead of `rm`
   - Use `New-Item` instead of `touch`
   - Use `Copy-Item` instead of `cp`
   - Use `Move-Item` instead of `mv`
   - Use backslashes `\` for Windows file paths

3. When generating terminal commands, ensure they are compatible with PowerShell.

4. File paths should use Windows-style backslashes or forward slashes (both work in PowerShell).

5. Be aware of PowerShell's different escaping rules, especially for special characters in strings.

6. Use PowerShell-native cmdlets when available for better integration with the Windows environment.
