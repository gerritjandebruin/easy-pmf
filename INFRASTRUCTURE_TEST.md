# Infrastructure Validation Test

This file is created to test the CI/CD infrastructure setup.

## Validation Checklist

- [x] GitHub Pages deployment
- [x] Environment protection rules configured
- [x] Branch protection with required status checks
- [x] Documentation updates completed
- [ ] End-to-end workflow validation (this PR)

## Environment Protection

The following environments are now protected:
- `release`: For PyPI publishing
- `test-pypi`: For TestPyPI publishing

Both require deployment from protected branches only.

## Branch Protection

Main branch protection includes:
- Required status checks: "CI Status"
- Required pull request reviews: 1 approving reviewer
- Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
- Restrict pushes that create merge commits

This file will be removed after validation is complete.
